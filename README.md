Here you can find the conditions of every task I solved for the course

1) Leap year: 

You want to determine if the given year is a leap year.
The program should work correctly on numbers 1900≤n≤3000.

Print "Leap" if the year read is a leap year and "Normal" otherwise (do not forget to check the case of the characters output by the program).

2) Heron's formula:

Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle from the transmitted lengths of its three sides using Heron's formula. 
The input should be integer number, the output of the program should be a real number corresponding to the area of the triangle.

3)
